## Introduction

This GoLang API is a basic implementation for testing purposes. It demonstrates how to create a simple API with GoLang using the [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) framework. You can use this repository as a starting point for building your own GoLang APIs or as a learning resource.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to set up and run the GoLang API locally.

### Prerequisites

- Go (version 1.16 or higher)
- Git (optional)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Supragya2912/go-api-test.git
   ```

   Alternatively, you can download the repository as a ZIP file and extract it.

2. Change the working directory to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd go-api-test
   ```

3. Build and run the API using the following command:

   ```bash
